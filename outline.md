## III: Let's Build a Game

### Similarities between Front End Dev and Game Dev

#### context/position aware
- use TD game as example

#### performance is key
- framerate
- load time

#### use analytics to improve your game
- how many people beat it?
- which levels to people quit at?
- which control scheme is most used?
- when do people play?
- how many people mute the game?
- how many people are experiencing a low frame rate?

## V: Go Make a Game

### Remix or Innovate, it doesn't matter

- Whether modifying a classic or building a brand new game, put your own twist or flavor into it

### Start small, build working prototypes that demonstrate the core game mechanic. See if it's fun before committing to the long haul.

### In the end, tools don't matter

- any medium is fine, just do it. dom, canvas, gamemaker, unity, board game, etc.
