## I: Game Dev is Amazing!



- The Ultimate Creative Expression
	- Visual Art / Graphics
	- Animation
	- Sound
	- Music
	- Interactivity
	- User Interface
	- Story / Writing / Dialogue / Characters
	- Cinematography
	- Artifical Intelligence

-Being able to control something on the screen and have an effect on the game world is pretty gosh darn delightful.

- nice to do something that doesn't involve money


- tons of ways to build games

	- there is a natural step forward for web devs
	- when starting out, give your self every advantage, use what you know




- games of the past
	- use them to learn concepts
	- put your own twist on it
	- build a functioning prototype

- your own games
	- hone in on a single game mechanic
	- build a working a prototype
	- if it's fun in it's most basic form, then you have something special and you should iterate





- watching other people play your game
	- seeing them have fun or get angry, both are equally enjoyable
