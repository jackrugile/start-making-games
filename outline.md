##### Develop Denver 2016

# Start Making Games

## I: Intro (Who the heck?)

### By Day

#### Jack Rugile
- Front End Developer at The Firm Graphics
- 28 year old introverted Virgo
- Loves sandwiches, cookies, pizza, and beer
- Approaches most things like ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
- @jackrugile on The Internet

### By Night

#### Jack Rugile (still)
- Hobby HTML5 Game Developer
- Game Jammer
- CodePen Demo Maker

### My Goal
- Get you to start making games
- Already do? Make more games. Make better games.















## II: Game Dev is Amazing

### It's also painful, frustrating, exhausting

### But mainly it's amazing!

### The Ultimate Creative Expression
- Visual Art / Graphics
- Animation
- Sound
- Music
- Interactivity
- User Interface
- Story / Writing / Dialogue / Characters
- Cinematography
- Artifical Intelligence

### Being able to control something on the screen and have an effect on the game world is pretty gosh darn delightful.













## III: Let's Build a Game

### Similarities between Front End Dev and Game Dev

#### context/position aware
- use TD game as example

#### performance is key
- framerate
- load time

#### use analytics to improve your game
- how many people beat it?
- which levels to people quit at?
- which control scheme is most used?
- when do people play?
- how many people mute the game?
- how many people are experiencing a low frame rate?

### What We're Making

## V: Go Make a Game

### Remix or Innovate, it doesn't matter

- Whether modifying a classic or building a brand new game, put your own twist or flavor into it

### Start small, build working prototypes that demonstrate the core game mechanic. See if it's fun before committing to the long haul.

### In the end, tools don't matter

- any medium is fine, just do it. dom, canvas, gamemaker, unity, board game, etc.
