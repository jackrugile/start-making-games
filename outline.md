## I: Game Dev is Amazing!

### It's also painful, frustrating, exhausting

### But mainly it's amazing!

### The Ultimate Creative Expression
- Visual Art / Graphics
- Animation
- Sound
- Music
- Interactivity
- User Interface
- Story / Writing / Dialogue / Characters
- Cinematography
- Artifical Intelligence

### Being able to control something on the screen and have an effect on the game world is pretty gosh darn delightful.

### Similarities between Front End Dev and Game Dev

#### context/position aware
- use TD game as example

#### performance is key

- load time

#### use analytics to improve your game

- which levels to people quit at?
- which control scheme is most used?

- how many people are experiencing a low frame rate?
