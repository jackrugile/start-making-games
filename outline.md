## I: Game Dev is Amazing!

### It's also painful, frustrating, exhausting

### But mainly it's amazing!

### The Ultimate Creative Expression
- Visual Art / Graphics
- Animation
- Sound
- Music
- Interactivity
- User Interface
- Story / Writing / Dialogue / Characters
- Cinematography
- Artifical Intelligence

### Being able to control something on the screen and have an effect on the game world is pretty gosh darn delightful.

### Similarities between Front End Dev and Game Dev

#### context/position aware
- use TD game as example

#### performance is key
- framerate
- load time

#### use analytics to improve your game
- how many people beat it?
- which levels to people quit at?
- which control scheme is most used?
- when do people play?
- how many people mute the game?
- how many people are experiencing a low frame rate?











## II: Let's Build a Game!










## III: Let's Make it Better!


- spike
	- even more strategy
	- make player feel powerful
	- slow motion for full charge
	- player gets slower, it's a tradeoff, 4th speed
- ghost
	- a boost to ai performance
	- needed once trajectory and spike were introduced
	- also, it sees further in the future and has less of a chance to be blind the higher your score gets
	- sometimes, even when you see the future, you don't have enough time to change it
- music
	- wrap it up with music






## Go Make a Game

### Remix or Innovate, it doesn't matter

- Whether modifying a classic or building a brand new game, put your own twist or flavor into it

### Start small, build working prototypes that demonstrate the core game mechanic. See if it's fun before committing to the long haul.

### In the end, tools don't matter

- any medium is fine, just do it. dom, canvas, gamemaker, unity, board game, etc.
