### My Goal

## II: Game Dev is Amazing

### It's also painful, frustrating, exhausting

### But mainly it's amazing!

### The Ultimate Creative Expression
- Visual Art / Graphics
- Animation
- Sound
- Music
- Interactivity
- User Interface
- Story / Writing / Dialogue
- Cinematography
- Artifical Intelligence

### Being able to control something on the screen and have an effect on the game world is pretty gosh darn delightful.

## III: Let's Build a Game

### What We're Making

#### Pong! 
- Cosmic Paddle Warfare 2084: Wimbledon in Ruins
- The Medieval Racketeer: A Tale from Love to Deuce
- Volley of the Vikings: A Quest for Valhalla

#### The DOM (The tools you know and love)

### HTML: Set the Stage

### CSS: Style the Game Objects

### JS: Game Logic

### AABB Collision Detection
	
## IV: Endless Possibilities

- shooting multiple balls at you
- trying to avoid the balls
- change the level for round pong
- add characters
- change setting
- add powerups
- add effects
- add sound
- add music
- add achievements
- control 2 at once
- add weather

## V: Go Make a Game

### Remix or Innovate, it doesn't matter

- Whether modifying a classic or building a brand new game,  put your own twist or flavor into it

### Start small, build working prototypes that demonstrate the core game mechanic. See if it's fun before committing to the long haul.

- easy to get started, difficult to master
- math plays a role
- don't need to know it all
- hide it away in a utility/helper function
- pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
- I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons
- show "where" we are when zoomed in on code
