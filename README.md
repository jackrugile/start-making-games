##### Develop Denver 2016

# Game Dev for the Front End Dev

## I: Intro (Who the heck?)

### By Day

#### Jack Rugile
- Front End Developer at The Firm Graphics
- 28 year old introverted Virgo
- Loves sandwiches, cookies, pizza, and beer
- @jackrugile on all the things

### By Night

#### Jack Rugile (still)
- Hobby HTML5 Game Developer
- Game Jammer
- CodePen Demo Maker

### My Goal
- Get you to start making games
- Already do? Make more games. Make better games.

## II: Game Dev is Awesome

### The Ultimate Creative Expression
- Graphics
- Animation
- Sound
- Music
- Interactivity
- User Interface
- Story
- Cinematography
- Artifical Intelligence

### Being able to control something on the screen and have an effect on the game world is pretty damn delightful.

## III: Build a Game

### What We're Making

#### Pong! 
- Cosmic Paddle Warfare 2084: Wimbledon in Ruins
- The Medieval Racketeer: A Tale from Love to Deuce
- Volley of the Vikings: A Quest for Valhalla

#### The DOM (The tools you know and love)

### HTML: Set the Stage

### CSS: Style the Game Objects

### JS: Game Logic

### AABB Collision Detection

	
## IV: Endless Possibilities

## V: Go Make a Game

### Remix or Innovate, it doesn't matter

- Whether modifying a classic or building a brand new game, always put your own twist or flavor into it

### Start small, build working prototypes that demonstrate the core game mechanic. See if it's fun before committing to the long haul.

### Game Jams

a simple example, a starting point
    where to go from here - create your own concepts
        everything is a remix - modify the classics
        build off initial pong game (premade demos, showing only concepts
            shooting multiple balls at you
            trying to avoid the balls
            change the level for round pong
            add characters
            change setting
            add powerups
            add effects
            add sound
            add music
            add achievements
Control 2 at once
    mention game jams
easy to get started, difficult to master
math plays a role
don't need to know it all
hide it away in a utility/helper function
pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons

show "where" we are when zoomed in on code

add weather
add spike
add increasing ai difficulty

# Tech Notes
- 16:9 or 4:3
- Large text
- Two fonts: Lato and (monospace TBD)
- High contrast mode
- Swapped lightness mode
- Control with keyboard and gamepad
- Limit raster images (none if possible)
- Simple transition between slides, hopefully not page reload
- Test thoroughly on laptop for performance, fullscreen, and sound
- Bring speakers in case sound is out of sync with visuals
