game dev for the front end dev
    intro / who I am / inspiration / why make games / where I started / similarities to front end dev
    a simple example, a starting point
        show how to build most basic pong with prewritten milestone points
    where to go from here - create your own concepts
        everything is a remix - modify the classics
        build off initial pong game (premade demos, showing only concepts
            shooting multiple balls at you
            trying to avoid the balls
            change the level for round pong
            add characters
            change setting
            add powerups
            add effects
            add sound
            add music
            add achievements
Control 2 at once
    mention game jams
easy to get started, difficult to master
math plays a role
don't need to know it all
hide it away in a utility/helper function
pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons

how many game devs out there?
do you even game dev, bro?
looking to get you to create your first game
if already game deving, get you to make your own

show "where" we are when zoomed in on code
show gamepad/arrow display of what's happening

high contrast mode just in case

ultimate creative expression
add weather
add spike
add increasing ai difficulty

canvas and css version available after?

AABB bounding box collisions
artificial fetching joke about dog and electric fence
use game controller to control
code with playing demo or gif
then code with visual explanation of game

# Tech Notes
- 16:9 or 4:3
- High contrast mode
- Swapped lightness mode
- Control with keyboard and gamepad
- Limit raster images (none if possible)
- Keep it somewhat classy, but still funny. Avoid GIFs.
- Simple transition between slides, hopefully not page reload
- Test thoroughly on laptop for performance, fullscreen, and sound
- Bring speakers in case sound is out of sync with visuals
