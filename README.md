game dev for the front end dev
    intro / who I am / inspiration / why make games / where I started / similarities to front end dev
    a simple example, a starting point
        show how to build most basic pong with prewritten milestone points
    where to go from here - create your own concepts
        everything is a remix - modify the classics
        build off initial pong game (premade demos, showing only concepts
            shooting multiple balls at you
            trying to avoid the balls
            change the level for round pong
            add characters
            change setting
            add powerups
            add effects
            add sound
            add music
            add achievements
Control 2 at once
    mention game jams
easy to get started, difficult to master
math plays a role
don't need to know it all
hide it away in a utility/helper function
pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons
