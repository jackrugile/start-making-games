# Tech Notes
- Invert HTML with filter if needed
- Test thoroughly on laptop for performance, fullscreen, and sound
- Pause / Step function?
- Mute function
- setup full code, full game, and half and half view
- be very careful about destroying all lingering items
- hide mouse after inactive mouse movement?
- get caffeine app for his laptop?
- disable all notifications
- cancel current ajax request when skipping slides fast, could cause a race issue
	- THIS HAPPENING - NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT
- naming convention
	- {section}-{type}-{desc}-{index}
	- type can be info, code, demo, or any combo of those
- why aren't line number start offsets working?

# Miscellaneous Points
- easy to get started, difficult to master
- math plays a role
- don't need to know it all
- hide it away in a utility/helper function
- pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
- I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons
- show "where" we are when zoomed in on code
- whole journey that other game developers have experience that you get to experience too
	- even if you weren't the one to invent or discover a concept, it still feels great to understand it and implement it in your own way
- compare hitbox sizes to front end dev
- show before and after
- developers can be lonely people, makes sense that we make ai
- pong is good because nothing gets added or removed
