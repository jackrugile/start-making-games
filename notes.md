# Miscellaneous Points
- easy to get started, difficult to master
- math plays a role
- don't need to know it all
- hide it away in a utility/helper function
- pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
- I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons
- show "where" we are when zoomed in on code
- whole journey that other game developers have experience that you get to experience too
	- even if you weren't the one to invent or discover a concept, it still feels great to understand it and implement it in your own way
