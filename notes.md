# Slide Notes
- New part introduction (swapped colors?)
- General text slide
- Code slide
- Demo slide (gamepad + arrow indicator)
- Code/Demo slide (gamepad + arrow indicator)
- Keep it somewhat classy, but still funny. Avoid GIFs.

# Tech Notes
- 16:9 or 4:3
- Large text
- Two fonts: Lato and (monospace TBD)
- High contrast mode
- Swapped lightness mode
- Control with keyboard and gamepad
- Limit raster images (none if possible)
- Simple transition between slides, hopefully not page reload
- Test thoroughly on laptop for performance, fullscreen, and sound
- Bring speakers in case sound is out of sync with visuals
- Opacity animations are causing the text to snap into a different mode (px shift)
- Option for audio calibration?
- Pause button
- Pause / Step function?
- Mute function
- top bar
	- dvlp dnvr logo
	- current slide?
- bot bar
	- controls being pressed
	- slide controls
- handle double layered controls, two playgrounds?
- setup full code, full game, and half and half view
- load fonts locally
- check if I can disable main playground loop
- be very careful about destroying all lingering items
- hide mouse after inactive mouse movent?
- get caffeine app for his laptop?
- cancel current ajax request when skipping slides fast, could cause a race issue

# Miscellaneous Points
- easy to get started, difficult to master
- math plays a role
- don't need to know it all
- hide it away in a utility/helper function
- pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
- I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons
- show "where" we are when zoomed in on code
- whole journey that other game developers have experience that you get to experience too
	- even if you weren't the one to invent or discover a concept, it still feels great to understand it and implement it in your own way
- compare hitbox sizes to front end dev
