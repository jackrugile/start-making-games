# Game Dev for the Front End Dev

## I: Intro (Who the heck?)

### By Day

#### Jack Rugile
- Front End Developer at The Firm Graphics
- 28 year old introverted Virgo
- Loves sandwiches, cookies, pizza, and beer
- @jackrugile on all the things

### By Night

#### Jack Rugile (still)
- Hobby HTML5 Game Developer
- Game Jammer
- CodePen Demo Maker

### My Goal
- Get you to start making games
- Already do? Make more games. Make better games.

## II: Game Dev is Amazing

### It's also painful, frustrating, exhausting

### But mainly it's amazing!

### The Ultimate Creative Expression
- Visual Art / Graphics
- Animation
- Sound
- Music
- Interactivity
- User Interface
- Story / Writing / Dialogue
- Cinematography
- Artifical Intelligence

### Being able to control something on the screen and have an effect on the game world is pretty gosh darn delightful.

## III: Let's Build a Game

### Similarities between Front End Dev and Game Dev

#### performance is key
- framerate
- load time

#### use analytics to improve your game
- how many people beat it?
- which levels to people quit at?
- which control scheme is most used?
- when do people play?
- how many people mute the game?
- how many people are experiencing a low frame rate?

### What We're Making

#### Bare Bones Pong! 
- Cosmic Paddle Warfare 2084: Wimbledon in Ruins
- The Medieval Racketeer: A Tale from Love to Deuce
- Volley of the Vikings: A Quest for Valhalla

#### The DOM (The tools you know and love)

### Coordinate System

### Drawing from Top Left of Shapes

### HTML: Set the Stage

### CSS: Style the Game Objects

### JS: Game Logic

### AABB Collision Detection
	
## IV: Endless Possibilities

### Explain Juice / Polish

### Gameplay Changes
- shooting multiple balls at you
- trying to avoid the balls
- change the level for round pong
- add powerups
- add spike move
- add increasing ai difficulty
- add graphics that help the player visualize certain behaviors
	- add edges to paddles to reflect collision detection
- illustrate benefits of good hitboxes vs bad hitboxes

### Non-Gameplay Changes
- colors
- add characters
- change setting
- add effects
- add sound
- add music
- add weather
- particles
- random screenshake
- accurate screenshake
- light flashes
- slow motion
- trails
- use svg for lines?
- goo filter
- all together

## V: Go Make a Game

### Remix or Innovate, it doesn't matter

- Whether modifying a classic or building a brand new game, put your own twist or flavor into it

### Start small, build working prototypes that demonstrate the core game mechanic. See if it's fun before committing to the long haul.

# Slide Notes
- New part introduction (swapped colors?)
- General text slide
- Code slide
- Demo slide (gamepad + arrow indicator)
- Code/Demo slide (gamepad + arrow indicator)
- Keep it somewhat classy, but still funny. Avoid GIFs.

# Tech Notes
- 16:9 or 4:3
- Large text
- Two fonts: Lato and (monospace TBD)
- High contrast mode
- Swapped lightness mode
- Control with keyboard and gamepad
- Limit raster images (none if possible)
- Simple transition between slides, hopefully not page reload

- Bring speakers in case sound is out of sync with visuals
- Opacity animations are causing the text to snap into a different mode (px shift)
- Option for audio calibration?
- Pause button
- Pause / Step function?

# Miscellaneous
- easy to get started, difficult to master
- math plays a role
- don't need to know it all
- hide it away in a utility/helper function
- pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
- I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons
- show "where" we are when zoomed in on code

# Pitches

## Pitch 1

Game development is an incredibly fun and challenging hobby that every developer should try. Creating a game requires you to merge artistic, logical, and playful parts of your thought process into one cohesive expression. It's the perfect next step for web developers because they already have the tools and skills they need to get started. My goal is to encourage you to start your game development journey.

Here's what you can expect from this talk:

- Learn why games are the ultimate creative expression and that every developer should explore.
- Examine the similarities and natural progression between web development and game development.
- Walk through fundamental core game development concepts through the creation of a bare bones classic game.
- Demo various game dev enhancements that can bring games to life.
- Get inspired to start making games!
