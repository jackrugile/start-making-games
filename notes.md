# Game Dev for the Front End Dev

## I: Intro (Who the heck?)

### By Day

#### Jack Rugile
- Front End Developer at The Firm Graphics
- 28 year old introverted Virgo
- Loves sandwiches, cookies, pizza, and beer
- @jackrugile on all the things

### By Night

#### Jack Rugile (still)
- Hobby HTML5 Game Developer
- Game Jammer
- CodePen Demo Maker

### My Goal
- Get you to start making games
- Already do? Make more games. Make better games.

## II: Game Dev is Amazing

### It's also painful, frustrating, exhausting

### But mainly it's amazing!

### The Ultimate Creative Expression
- Visual Art / Graphics
- Animation
- Sound
- Music
- Interactivity
- User Interface
- Story / Writing / Dialogue
- Cinematography
- Artifical Intelligence

### Being able to control something on the screen and have an effect on the game world is pretty gosh darn delightful.

## III: Let's Build a Game

### Similarities between Front End Dev and Game Dev

#### performance is key
- framerate
- load time

#### use analytics to improve your game
- how many people beat it?
- which levels to people quit at?
- which control scheme is most used?
- when do people play?
- how many people mute the game?
- how many people are experiencing a low frame rate?

### What We're Making

#### Pong! 
- Cosmic Paddle Warfare 2084: Wimbledon in Ruins
- The Medieval Racketeer: A Tale from Love to Deuce
- Volley of the Vikings: A Quest for Valhalla

#### The DOM (The tools you know and love)

### Coordinate System

### Drawing from Top Left of Shapes

### HTML: Set the Stage

### CSS: Style the Game Objects

### JS: Game Logic

### AABB Collision Detection
	
## IV: Endless Possibilities

### Explain Juice / Polish

### Gameplay Changes
- shooting multiple balls at you
- trying to avoid the balls
- change the level for round pong
- add powerups
- add spike move
- add increasing ai difficulty
- add graphics that help the player visualize certain behaviors
	- add edges to paddles to reflect collision detection
- illustrate benefits of good hitboxes vs bad hitboxes

### Non-Gameplay Changes
- colors
- add characters
- change setting
- add effects
- add sound
- add music
- add weather
- particles
- random screenshake
- accurate screenshake
- light flashes
- slow motion
- trails
- use svg for lines?
- goo filter
- all together

## V: Go Make a Game

### Remix or Innovate, it doesn't matter

- Whether modifying a classic or building a brand new game, put your own twist or flavor into it

### Start small, build working prototypes that demonstrate the core game mechanic. See if it's fun before committing to the long haul.

# Slide Notes
- New part introduction (swapped colors?)
- General text slide
- Code slide
- Demo slide (gamepad + arrow indicator)
- Code/Demo slide (gamepad + arrow indicator)
- Keep it somewhat classy, but still funny. Avoid GIFs.

# Tech Notes
- 16:9 or 4:3
- Large text
- Two fonts: Lato and (monospace TBD)
- High contrast mode
- Swapped lightness mode
- Control with keyboard and gamepad
- Limit raster images (none if possible)
- Simple transition between slides, hopefully not page reload
- Test thoroughly on laptop for performance, fullscreen, and sound
- Bring speakers in case sound is out of sync with visuals
- Opacity animations are causing the text to snap into a different mode (px shift)
- Option for audio calibration?

# Miscellaneous
- easy to get started, difficult to master
- math plays a role
- don't need to know it all
- hide it away in a utility/helper function
- pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
- I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons
- show "where" we are when zoomed in on code
