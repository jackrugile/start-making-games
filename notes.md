# Tech Notes
- Test thoroughly on laptop for performance, fullscreen, and sound
- Pause / Step function?
- Mute function
- be very careful about destroying all lingering items
- get caffeine app for his laptop?
- disable all notifications
- cancel current ajax request when skipping slides fast, could cause a race issue
	- THIS HAPPENING - NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT
- naming convention
	- {section}-{type}-{desc}-{index}
	- type can be info, code, demo, or any combo of those
- what slides need special illustrations?
	- aabb collision detection
- make slides controllable from one hand?
- hide cursor after inactivity
- test with disabled internet connection
- test gamepad controls at work - on system with no gamepad apps
- preload all fonts to prevent fout
- use scale3d intsead of scale on both wrap and pong?
	- this is in place, not sure if it is more performant though. need test environment on laptop and retina
	- if 3d caused texture, maybe a smaller starting point makes more sense
- tennis ball sounds?
	- https://audiojungle.net/user/sound-ideas/portfolio?page=1&term=tennis&utf8=%E2%9C%93
- grunt sounds?
	- https://audiojungle.net/item/male-grunts/12294357?s_rank=14
- integrate timescale for dt and slow motion
	- issue with screenshake not being affected by it?
	- match sfx to timescale? maybe not as intense of a drop down
- if enemy on edge, always calc new trajectory
- image for background?
- drag vs friction?
- circle or rotate rectangle for paddle
	- settle back to original rotation when not holding left or right
	- rotated rect collision detection?

# Miscellaneous Points
- easy to get started, difficult to master
- math plays a role
- don't need to know it all
- hide it away in a utility/helper function
- pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
- I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons
- whole journey that other game developers have experience that you get to experience too
	- even if you weren't the one to invent or discover a concept, it still feels great to understand it and implement it in your own way
- compare hitbox sizes to front end dev
- show before and after
- developers can be lonely people, makes sense that we make ai
- pong is good because nothing gets added or removed
- explain request animation frame
	- sync game updates and rendering to the browser painting process
	- aims for 60fps
	- prevents dropped frames
	- stops running when browser window/tab is not in focus
- explain why animation through loop vs animation or transition
- bang for your buck with playrate on audio
- judge the end result before you even think about juding the code
