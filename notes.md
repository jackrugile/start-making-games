# Tech Notes
- use scale3d insead of scale on both wrap and pong?
	- this is in place, not sure if it is more performant though. need test environment on laptop and retina
	- if 3d caused texture, maybe a smaller starting point makes more sense
- tennis ball sounds?
	- https://audiojungle.net/user/sound-ideas/portfolio?page=1&term=tennis&utf8=%E2%9C%93
- grunt sounds?
	- https://audiojungle.net/item/male-grunts/12294357?s_rank=14
- match sfx to timescale? maybe not as intense of a drop down
- charge spike, rumble, particle explosion, and slow mo on mega spike
	- slow down paddle when charging?
- if time is running low, ditch the step by step juice/polish and add it all at once
- make paddle rotate/react to ball hit
- make score max 3?
- cuboid issues on firefox

# Miscellaneous Points
- easy to get started, difficult to master
- math plays a role
- don't need to know it all
- hide it away in a utility/helper function
- pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
- I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons
- whole journey that other game developers have experience that you get to experience too
	- even if you weren't the one to invent or discover a concept, it still feels great to understand it and implement it in your own way
- compare hitbox sizes to front end dev
- show before and after
- developers can be lonely people, makes sense that we make ai
- pong is good because nothing gets added or removed
- explain request animation frame
	- sync game updates and rendering to the browser painting process
	- aims for 60fps
	- prevents dropped frames
	- stops running when browser window/tab is not in focus
- explain why animation through loop vs animation or transition
- bang for your buck with playrate on audio
- judge the end result before you even think about juding the code
- always give a reason not to press a button
- getting to watch people play and react to your game is awesome
- build is roughly ~300 LOC
