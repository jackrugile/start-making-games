# Tech Notes
- use scale3d instead of scale on both wrap and pong?
- cuboid issues on firefox
- perf mode, fewer particles
- prep codepen demo too! (one aspect of game?) or chromatic abberation
- change dir display? remove left and right, add spike charge indicator
- trim down bullet notes at the end for juice?

# Miscellaneous Points
- easy to get started, difficult to master
- math plays a role
- don't need to know it all
- hide it away in a utility/helper function
- pythagoreans theorem? totally useful!
- I don't learn all the math because of pythagoreasons
- whole journey that other game developers have experience that you get to experience too
	- even if you weren't the one to invent or discover a concept, it still feels great to understand it and implement it in your own way
- compare hitbox sizes to front end dev
- show before and after
- developers can be lonely people, makes sense that we make ai
- pong is good because nothing gets added or removed
- explain request animation frame
	- sync game updates and rendering to the browser painting process
	- aims for 60fps
	- prevents dropped frames
	- stops running when browser window/tab is not in focus
- explain why animation through loop vs animation or transition
- bang for your buck with playrate on audio
- judge the end result before you even think about juding the code
- always give a reason not to press a button
- getting to watch people play and react to your game is awesome
- build is roughly ~300 LOC
