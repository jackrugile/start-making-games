<div class="notes">
- Remix or Innovate, it doesn't matter
- Whether modifying a classic or building a brand new game, put your own twist or flavor into it
- Start small, build working prototypes that demonstrate the core game mechanic. See if it's fun before committing to the long haul.
- In the end, tools don't matter
- any medium is fine, just do it. dom, canvas, gamemaker, unity, board game, etc.
